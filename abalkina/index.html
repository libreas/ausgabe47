<p>Hijacked journals (also known as cloned journals) are a type of
cybercrime. They copy the title, ISSN, and other metadata of legitimate
journals and claim to be the authentic journal in order to attract
authors and publish their papers in exchange for article processing
charges (Abalkina, 2021; Jalalian &amp; Dadkhah, 2015; Moussa, 2021).
This phenomenon was first documented around 2011 (Jalalian &amp;
Dadkhah, 2015). Since then, hundreds of journals have been hijacked.</p>
<p>There are two methods of journal hijacking. First, fraudulent
publishers create an alternative website for an existing journal,
claiming that it is the genuine one (see Figure 1). This type of
hijacking can be successful because they target print-only journals, and
the fake website becomes the only visible online presence of the
journal. They also clone journals published in local languages. This
strategy has been especially effective with Chinese journals.</p>

Medicine</em>: authentic and cloned websites</strong></p>

<p>Another method is to register the expired web domain of an existing
journal (Bohannon, 2015). This can happen when a journal ceases
publication or when the original publisher fails to renew the domain
registration. For example, the <em>Russian Law Journal</em> ceased
publication, a fraudulent publisher registered its expired domain and
created a journal website of the <em>Russian Law Journal</em> and
accepted hundreds of papers in different disciplines, which were
subsequently indexed in Web of Science (Abalkina, 2023b) (see Figure
2).</p>

<p>More than 400 cases of hijacked journals have been documented since
2012 across different lists. The first list was created by the
US-American librarian Jeffrey Beall, but he stopped updating it in 2017.
Cabell’s, a paywalled database of journals, also includes hijacked
journals as part of its criteria in <em>Predatory Reports</em>, which
evaluates journals based on deceptive, fraudulent, or predatory
practices. Another list has been compiled by UGC CARE in India<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, which includes Cloned List I for
local hijacked journals and Cloned List II for those indexed in
international databases. However, UGC CARE is discontinuing its journal
list used for research evaluation purposes (The Economic Times, 2025).
It is unclear whether the lists of cloned journals will continue to be
updated. Another list is the Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, created in May 2022 and regularly
updated. As of May 2025, the list includes more than 350 entries of
hijacked journals.</p>
<p>The majority of original journals have been hijacked once, though
some are associated with two cloned websites. The case of the Seybold
Journal is notable, with five cloned websites (Abalkina, 2023a). Such
multiple cloning of journals by different fraudulent publishers can be
explained by the fact that certain types of legitimate journals are
particularly targeted, for example, trade journals, small, niche and
print-only journals, or journals published in local languages (Jalalian
&amp; Mahboobi, 2014; Shahri et al., 2018). Hijackers normally don’t
clone journals by major publishers, though individual cases have been
reported. For instance, in 2024 a fraudulent publisher cloned 13
journals published by Elsevier, Springer, etc. (Abalkina, 2024a). A
striking detail is that the cloned webpages were identical to the
authentic journals, the only difference was the web domain address,
which was slightly different from the original.</p>
<p>Hijacked journals are not as numerous as predatory journals, but
their proliferation also poses a significant challenge to the scientific
community. They threaten scientific integrity by offering rapid
publication without peer review, distorting international database
indexes, and serving as repositories for low-quality papers and research
involving misconduct. Such papers are nonetheless cited in reputable
journals and indexed in various bibliographic databases.</p>
<p>There is evidence that unreviewed papers published in hijacked
journals can be indexed in Scopus or Web of Science. A study by Abalkina
(2024b) identified 67 hijacked journals that have penetrated Scopus
since 2013, of which 33 have indexed unauthorized content, 23
compromised the journal’s homepage link in Scopus, and 11 did both.
There is also evidence of hijacked journals penetrating Web of Science
(Abalkina, 2023b; Butler, 2013). Hijacked journals are indexed in Google
Scholar as well, and scholars should be cautious when retrieving data or
conducting literature searches through this platform.</p>
<h3 id="features-of-hijacked-journals">Features of hijacked
journals</h3>
<p>Hijacked journals present themselves as multidisciplinary journals.
The topics of the papers they accept are usually from various
disciplines and often do not correspond to the title of the journal.
This happens because hijacked journals aim to accept as many papers as
possible to maximize their profit. Low article processing charges (APCs)
are another potential <q>red flag</q> of a fraudulent journal. Bhasker
and Solomon (2025) note that low APCs of $25 per article are a specific
diagnostic indicator of pseudo-journals. Such low fees can be explained
by the limited payment capacity in countries where most authors
publishing in hijacked journals are based, for example India, Indonesia,
Uzbekistan, etc.</p>
<p>Hijacked journals publish papers within a matter of days, which is
problematic because a genuine publication process requires both
editorial assessment of the manuscript and a peer review process, both
of which take time.</p>
<p>Hijacked journals may assign fake DOIs starting with numbers such as
12, 16 or 20 (see Figure 3), although a legitimate DOI always begins
with 10. Sometimes, fraudulent publishers register real DOIs for
hijacked journals. In such cases, it is possible to identify that the
publisher is not the original one by cross-checking the information in
the ISSN Portal or Crossref.</p>

<p>Some hijacked journals provide fake editorial boards or copy them
from other journals. They may also present fabricated journal metrics
and incorrect impact factor values (Dadkhah et al., 2016) and claim
indexation in different bibliographic databases, such as Scopus or Web
of Science.</p>
<p>One of the red flags of hijacked journals is an anonymously
registered and recently created domain, which can be verified using a
WHOIS service. A recent registration makes it difficult for a hijacked
journal to demonstrate a history of regular publication or the
availability of an archive, which potential authors expect to see in a
legitimate journal. For this reason, hijacked journals may create a fake
archive filled with articles copied from other hijacked journals or
generated by AI (Abalkina, 2021). Often the texts of these archived
papers are not accessible due to paywall, likely because they do not
exist. However, an archive is an important feature of a journal, as it
indicates the continuous publication of journal issues (Dony et al.,
2020).</p>
<h3 id="what-can-be-done-recommendations-for-journals">What Can Be Done?
Recommendations for Journals</h3>
<p>Authentic journals that are hijacked face several challenges. They
experience an increased editorial workload due to letters from authors
who have fallen victim to the hijacked versions. Editors must take
additional measures to prevent further damage to the journal, neutralize
the hijacked version, and take steps to restore accurate information in
bibliographic databases if the hijacked journal has led to the indexing
of unauthorized content. Müller &amp; Sæbø (2023) discuss such
challenges in the case of the hijacking of their journal,
<em>Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems</em>.</p>
<p>These challenges highlight the need for a proactive response from
journals and editors in case of hijacking. The following measures can
help journals to prevent hijacking, protect the journal and potential
authors, as well as mitigate the negative effects caused by
hijacking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the security of the journal's website and renew the domain
registration in a timely manner. Passwords and access credentials should
be stored securely. It is also important to plan for situations in which
a colleague who holds the access credentials leaves the job and there
should always be an alternative means of access to data storage. There
have been cases where journals lost their web domains because they were
unable to regain access.</li>
<li>Journals should improve their search engine optimization (SEO), as
hijacked journals actively promote fraudulent websites that often appear
among the top search results in different search engines.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case of hijacking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit a complaint to the domain registrar and hosting provider.
Provide all available evidence of the illegitimate use of the journal’s
title, ISSN, and other metadata. Include the details of the hijacked
journal and any known contact information.</li>
<li>You may consider contacting Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, etc., to
disrupt the payment process of the hijacked journal if it is receiving
payments for publications.</li>
<li>Publish information about the journal hijacking on the homepage of
the legitimate journal's website to inform authors about the fraudulent
site. If the website is in a language other than English, consider
adding the message in English as well, since the main victims of journal
hijacking are often authors from East, South, and Central Asia.</li>
<li>Inform the Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker about the
hijacking case by filling out the form<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
Please also indicate the original website. If the case is confirmed, the
database will be updated accordingly.</li>
<li>If the journal has lost its web domain, inform indexing databases
(e. g., Scopus, Web of Science, Scimago, DOAJ) about the case.
Fraudulent publishers may use the domain to host a fake journal and
index unreviewed papers in various bibliographic databases.</li>
<li>Fraudulent publishers may also register a new DOI prefix for the
hijacked journal. This can be checked via the Crossref title list<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. If this has occurred, provide all
available evidence of hijacking to Crossref. This may lead to the
exclusion of the member from Crossref like in the case of a suspicious
<q>Springer Global Publications</q> which had cloned the website of
journals published by Springer, Elsevier, and other major publishers
(Kincaid, 2024).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Hijacked journals are a type of fraudulent journal that poses a
significant challenge to academic publishing by exploiting the
reputation of legitimate journals. The proliferation of hijacked
journals highlights vulnerabilities in the scholarly communication
infrastructure, insufficient verification processes in indexing
databases, limited awareness of the problem, and the use of publications
in hijacked journals for research evaluation.</p>
<p>Tackling the problem of hijacked journals requires a coordinated and
proactive response from multiple stakeholders. This includes stronger
verification and response mechanisms from indexing databases, increased
awareness of the issue, educating scholars on how to recognize hijacked
journals to avoid submitting papers to or citing from them, and
preventive actions by legitimate journals to protect themselves from
being hijacked.</p>
